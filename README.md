# What is PanOracle?

PanOracle Lab was founded in February 2020 aiming at building a decentralized network of oracle which dedicated to work on the external information written into the blockchain. Which could offer a solution of decentralizing Oracle mechanism between blockchian and the real world. PanOracle allows smart contracts react to unknown external world in order to make blockchain capable of functioning in actual world practical applications.

PanOracle believes that the oracle as the bridge between blockchain and real world extends its application scenarios, it will cover various DApp categories such as financial derivatives trading platforms, lending platforms, express tracking/IoT, stable coins, games, insurance, prediction markets, etc.

PanOracle provides a decentralized Service platform for all DApps to serve data interacting with the real world. Through the interaction between the smart contract Service Contract and the Oracle Contract, it enables the blockchain data to interact with the external world and ensures the accuracy and reliability of the oracle data.

In the design of Off-chain, PanOracle proposed DAO voting, which accuracy and applicability were verified by Paella.

In order to prevent the trust problem of node propagators, PanOracle propagators are co-executed by multiple decentralized nodes for request processing of propagator data. PanOracle aggregation algorithm will have BFT consensus algorithm and DAO voting to govern together.

# What is Pan?

The first token PAN by PanOracle was used to promote the PanOracle mechanism and build the PanOracle community. The PAN mechanism generates revenue for holding the tokens and provides an environment for PanOracle’s prophets.

# What is Pealla?

Paella is a contract token issued by PanOracle and the only PanOracle equity token.Paella’s price will be prophesied in the oracle, through voting in the Oracle Service’s built-in DAO to ensure prophecy validity, and Paella will be the only Gas fee token when the DApp acquires the oracle interaction.

Paella is also a ductility algorithmic value-added coin issued by PanOracle, the coin’s price will increase or decrease the amount of Paella held by the address through volatility every 4 hours.

# Pan Benefits

## Total Supply: 10 billion Pan

100% for marketing

## PAN is programmed to reward holders. It does this by applying a 10% tax on transactions:

* **5% goes to BNB-PAN Liquidity Pool** 

* **3% goes to CAKE Reward Pool**

* **1% goes to BNB Reward Pool**

* **1% will be burnt** 

**Simply hold $Pan tokens in your wallet and earn daily rewards in BNB + CAKE!**

## Develop Fee

If you collect more than **1 BNB**, **20%** of it will be used to donate to PanOracle development team**.** This feature helps us to continuously improve our products！

## Anti Whales

Since the transactions (sell/buy and wallet transfer) that trade more than 5% of the total supply will be rejected. We developed a feature on our dAPP(<http://panoracle.com/>) of disruptive transfers.

Whales who make a transfer (between 2 wallets) that is larger than 5% of the total supply will be charged for 1 BNB. These 1 BNBs go straight to the BNB reward pool in the Earn BNB feature.

## Collection Time

You will have to wait for a specific duration called cycle (**12 hours**) to collect your **BNB+CAKE** reward. In this waiting duration, if you continue to add **PAN** balance, the waiting duration will be refreshed.

# Pealla Benifits

The PanOracle Volatility Prognosis will be calculated in every 4 hours using the price fluctuations, the volatility is determined by the range of fluctuations and the volatility constants.

## Token Distribution

Paella, initial offer 600,000 tokens, following adjustment will be made by Paella real-time liquidity which follow by market fluctuations and self-adjustment of holding fluctuations predicted by the oracle. The initial price of Paella will be anchored at 1 USDT and the fund-raising limit for a single address will be 500 USDT, with a weighted allocation based on the number of fundraisers and a full winning amount for those who participate in the white list.

300,000 Paella will be distributed directly to participating fund raising addresses for market circulation to make the Paella price volatile.The development team will allocate 5% of the increasing amount as the ongoing development costs and ecological exPaellasion costs, this is the strategy used to forward adjusts the number of Paella addresses held.3% of the increase will be allocated by the DAO pool as DAO pool incentive and 2% of the increase will be allocated by the LP pool as LP farming incentive.

## DAO Benefits

When the price of Paella increases, the amount of Paella held by the address will increase proportionally based on the price volatility , the assets staked by the DFO pool will also increase proportionally, and 3% of the total increase will be used as the DAO pool incentive.

When the price of Paella falls, the amount of Paella held by the address will decrease in proportion to the price volatility , but the amount of holdings going into the DAO pool will not decrease in proportion to the price volatility.

All addresses in the DAO pool is staked can be deposit or withdraw, and all DAO pools has equal weighting. After the DAO pool application is withdrawn, the addresses will wait for redemption according to the corresponding DAO pool cycle, and the staked Paella in the DAO can be withdrawn at any time after the end of the waiting cycle.

## Paella Price Expectation Incentive

When the Paella price reaches each price expectation, Paella will add the same amount of Paella as the initial issue for DAO pool incentive, and all addresses participating in the DAO pool will be weighted to allocate Paella.When all three price expectations are met, PanOracle will open the actual application to use Paella to build the PanOracle ecology.

# Paella Price Expectation Incentive

To test the accuracy and effectiveness of PanOracle, PanOracle will prophesy three stages of price trends, 10X, 20X, 80X, where X represents the initial price.

When the Paella price reaches each price expectation, Paella will add the same amount of Paella as the initial issue for DAO pool incentive, and all addresses participating in the DAO pool will be weighted to allocate Paella.

When all three price expectations are met, PanOracle will open the actual application to use Paella to build the PanOracle ecology.

PanOracle will serve all Dapps that need to communicate with external data for the oracle, which will include chat, sense information, random seed, payment, insurance, market prediction, etc.

As a gateway for smart contract and external communication, PanOracle will become a bridge for blockchain to interact with the external world, facilitating various Dapps to effectively and quickly build application scenarios and cast PanOracle ecology.
